# flashcard_netplus
Simple flashcard program for CompTIA Network Plus and Security Plus test takers
using a web based converter to make JSON object
current version is cached const with no styling as I'm using it to take the tests myself
feel free to view live below:

Future updates:
working to make ajax call to JSON object on webserver
then I'll add styling, logic and menus
