What direction is considered forward for a proxy?,Facing outward from the network.,network defense,FALSE,TRUE
What does a reverse proxy do?,Mediates communications between internet clients and LAN servers.,network defense,FALSE,TRUE
Is SSL open source?,"No, SSL was developed by Netscape.",network defense,FALSE,TRUE
Is TLS open source?,Yes.,network defense,FALSE,TRUE
What type of cryptography do SSL and TLS use?,"Assymetric key exchange, symmetric bulk encryption.",network defense,FALSE,TRUE
What direction do SSL and TLS authenticate?,"Dual authentication and one way are possible, but HTTPS usually only authenticates the server.",network defense,FALSE,TRUE
What applications use SSL encryption?,"HTTPS, FTPS, SMTP, SNMPv3, EAP-TLS, SSL VPN",network defense,FALSE,TRUE
Which protocols are included in secure shell?,"SCP, rsync, SFTP",network defense,FALSE,TRUE
How does S/MIME encrypt and authenticate?,x.509 certificates,network defense,FALSE,TRUE
What layer 2 VPN solution offers native support by most operating systems?,Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol/Ipsec,network defense,FALSE,TRUE
How does PPTP work?,Point to Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) sends PPP packets over GRE.,network defense,FALSE,TRUE
What is GRE?,Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) encapsulates L# protocol in a point to point link.,network defense,FALSE,TRUE
What protocols make up IPsec?,"Internet Key Exchange (IKE), Authentication Header (AH), Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP).",network defense,FALSE,TRUE
What are the two modes of IPsec?,Tunnel mode and transport mode.,network defense,FALSE,TRUE
How does Ipsec operate in tunnel mode?,Encapsulates IP packet with AH or ESP.,network defense,FALSE,TRUE
How does Ipsec operate in transport mode?,Encrypts payload.,network defense,FALSE,TRUE
What is the difference between FTPS and SFTP?,FTPS uses SSL while SFTP uses SSH2,network defense,FALSE,TRUE
What is the smallest network segment?,Collision domain.,network defense,FALSE,TRUE
What is the fundamental unit of segmentation on a modern switched Ethernet network?,Broadcast domain.,network defense,FALSE,TRUE
What is commonly the best L2 segmentation option?,Use VLANs to logically separate traffic on a physically switched network.,network defense,FALSE,TRUE
How should network zones with different security needs be separated?,"Chokepoints, no traffic should be allowed to bass between networks without evaluation by a secured chokepoint.",network defense,FALSE,TRUE
What are some considerations in placing a chokepoint?,"They are a good place for firewalls and IDS and IPS, but ensure the chokepoint can handle epected traffic.",network defense,FALSE,TRUE
